Overview
This Spring Boot application calculates an optimal schedule for charging trucks. The scheduling is based on a specific algorithm (the "Closest Sum Algorithm"), which pairs trucks with chargers in such a way that minimizes charging waste. The system takes into account the number of hours the chargers will be active, the trucks' charging needs, and the available charger capacity.

Features
Scheduling of trucks to chargers.
Closest sum algorithm to match trucks with chargers.
Dynamic assignment of trucks based on charger capacity.
Flexibility to handle edge cases such as no available chargers or trucks.
